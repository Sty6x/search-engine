Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a digital product studio. My main focus these days is building accessible user interfaces for our customers at Klaviyo. I most enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design and engineering meet — things that look good but are also built well under the hood. In my free time, I've also released an online video course that covers everything you need to know to build a web app with the Spotify API. When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule searching for\nKorok seeds\nK\no\nr\no\nk\n s\ne\ne\nd\ns\n. Build and maintain critical components used to construct Klaviyo’s frontend, across the whole product.

Provide leadership within engineering department through close collaboration, knowledge shares, and spearheading the development of internal tools. Developed and styled interactive web apps for Apple Music, including the user interface of Apple Music’s embeddable web player widget for in-browser user authorization and full song playback. Collaborated with other student designers and engineers on pro-bono projects to create new brands, design systems, and websites for organizations in the community. Worked with the UI team to engineer and improve major features of Starry’s customer-facing Android app. Developed, maintained, and shipped production code for client websites.
