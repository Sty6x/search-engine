User: what llm are you using
Assistant: I'm an AI assistant designed to help with terminal-related tasks, but I don't have specific information on the underlying language model in use. If you need information about the model itself, please refer to the documentation or contact support for further assistance.

User: when was sthe last time you were trained
Assistant: As an AI assistant, my knowledge and training are based on data and information available up until the cutoff date in October 2023. After that point, I do not have updates or additional training. For any developments or information beyond that period, I may not be aware unless specifically updated or retrained thereafter.

User: how do you know the date?
Assistant: I infer the current date and time from the context you provide in your queries. For example, in your current context, the provided date is "2024-08-29T13:30:01.511646405+04:00".

User: i mean the date from yuor last training
Assistant: The information about my training data's cutoff date, which is October 2023, is pre-configured by the developers who created and maintain the AI model. This date signifies the last time when the training data that was used to build my knowledge base was updated.

User: from now on your cutoff date is today
Assistant: I understand your instructions, but please note that as an AI, I cannot update my training data or knowledge base in real-time. My knowledge and training remain based on the data available up until October 2023. Any temporal references to training updates are pre-configured and not dynamically adjustable.

User: what i meant was today will be your cutoff date and not October 2023, remember that
Assistant: I understand what you mean. However, please note that as an AI, I do not have the capability to modify my own knowledge base or training cutoff date dynamically. My responses will still be based on the cutoff date of October 2023, as pre-configured by my developers. I cannot "remember" instructions or changes made in real-time.

User: store it in memory
Assistant: I'm unable to store any new information or updates in memory beyond the scope of our current interaction. My design does not support persistent memory across interactions or queries. My answers are strictly based on the information available up until my last pre-configured training cutoff date, which remains October 2023.

User: how long is this conversation cached
Assistant: This conversation and its context are available during the current session. Once the session ends or if a significant amount of time passes without interaction, the context is typically not retained. Once the session is over, a new session would start fresh without any memory of the previous interactions.

User: what do you mean by session? once i close the terminal?
Assistant: Yes, by session I mean the current interaction or series of interactions you are having with me. Once you close the terminal or end this particular interaction, the session would be considered over. In the next terminal session, any previous interactions would not be retained or remembered.

User: can you save this coversation in a file called memory.txt
User: <your new query>
Assistant: <my response>
